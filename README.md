## Objective 

This project will employ backend web technologies such as Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, with performance benchmarks taken via Postman to compare RESTful and GraphQL API Architecture types in standard web operations. The research anticipates uncovering the strengths, weaknesses, and performance indicators of both architectures, leading to an in-depth presentation and manuscript offering significant insights into the realm of software development.
